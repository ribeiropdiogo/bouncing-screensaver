This repository contains a collection of custom bouncing screensaver built for MacOS. This project started as a simple effort to customize MacOS but evolved into this repository so that anyone can use any of the published screensaver in their own machine. This repository contains all screensavers built to date, but feel free to suggest new ones! Additionally, the Xcode project used to generate the screensavers is also present in the repository. So, if you feel brave, try adding new ones yourself.

## Installing 🚀

To install any of the screensavers clone this repository or download it using your browser. After this step, go to the location where you have stored the screensaver(s) and **double-click** the **screensaver** you want to use. Accept any security notifications, and after that, you should be able to see the `bouncing screensaver` in `System Preferences -> Desktop & Screen Saver`.

## Compatibility 📦

- macOS Monterey (12) and above
- Natively compiled for x86
- Xcode 14.1 and aboce

## Development 🔧

To create new screensavers using the Xcode project in this repository, you can follow one of two options: either open the `bouncing screensaver` folder and double-click the `bouncing screensaver.xcodeproj`, or open Xcode, select `Open a project or file`, and then select the `bouncing screensaver` folder or `bouncing screensaver.xcodeproj` file. Either way works perfectly and it is up to your preference. Just make sure to have Xcode installed on your machine and updated to a relatively new version (14.1 or newer).
