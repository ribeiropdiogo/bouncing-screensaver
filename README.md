This repository contains a collection of custom bouncing screensaver built for MacOS. This project started as a simple effort to customize MacOS but evolved into this repository so that anyone can use any of the published screensaver in their own machine. This repository contains all screensavers built to date, but feel free to suggest new ones!

## Installing

To install any of the screensavers clone this repository or download it using your browser. After this step, go to the location where you have stored the screensaver(s) and **double-click** the **screensaver** you want to use. Accept any security notifications, and after that, you should be able to see the `bouncing screensaver` in `System Preferences -> Desktop & Screen Saver`.

## Compatibility

- macOS Monterey (12) and above
- Natively compiled for x86
